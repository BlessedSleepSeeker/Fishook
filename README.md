## Playtest Alpha 0.0.1

Playtest subject : first playtest, 3D platforming only.

Commons feedback :

- Delay on hook activation is unintuitive and/or too long
  - Most people expect click -> attached
- Camera issue when going full up, can't see anything
- DJ input must release hookshot state instead of DJ
- Collectibles hitboxes are too small/feels like should be picked up
- Need to know where we are locked
- Using the grab is fun !!!!

Less Common Feeback :

- Feature to be able to reel out. (Reel In is cool already)
- Controller support please
- Accessibility : Aim assist for the hook
- Low-Poly is cute :D
- Everything should be grabbable.
- Allow to shot hookshot from the ground and let the hookshot attached when landing.
- Need more feedback when throwing the hook : rework animation, add SFX, VFX, UI Indicators

Unique Feedback  :

- No settings/pause in game ?
- Make out of range indicator clearer

Bugs :

- Running from a plat to the void locks you into running state without going to fall.

Personal Thoughts :

- Went well !
- Lots of work on
- Display the crosshair when jumping, fade it away when in idle for extended period of time
  -> this is about allowing 2 experiences to co-exist : both the speedrun enthusiast who want to schmoove and the chill panorama enjoyer.
